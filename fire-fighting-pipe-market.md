<p><strong>The Fire Fighting Pipe Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinkler System</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinkler System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The firefighting pipe market primarily serves two key applications: wet fire sprinkler systems and dry fire sprinkler systems. Wet systems are filled with water and activate automatically when heat triggers the sprinklers, suitable for environments where freezing is not a concern. In contrast, dry systems contain pressurized air and release water only when the sprinkler is activated, making them ideal for colder climates where pipes could freeze. Both systems enhance fire safety in residential, commercial, and industrial settings.</p></p>
