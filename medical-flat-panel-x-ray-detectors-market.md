<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical flat panel X-ray detectors are pivotal in modern radiology, categorized into two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a two-step process, where X-rays first convert to light, then the light is transformed into an electrical signal. This method often provides high image quality. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into an electrical signal, which can result in improved spatial resolution and reduced noise. Each type serves specific clinical needs and preferences in imaging.</p></p>
