<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Encoders</li><li>Absolute Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modular encoder market consists primarily of two types: incremental and absolute encoders. Incremental encoders provide relative position changes and are ideal for applications requiring speed and direction detection. They generate pulses as the shaft rotates, allowing for real-time feedback. In contrast, absolute encoders offer a unique position value for each shaft angle and retain this information even when powered down, making them suitable for precision applications where exact positioning is critical. Both types play crucial roles in automation and control systems.</p></p>
