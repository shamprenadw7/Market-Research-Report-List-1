<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emergency External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Emergency External Defibrillators market is segmented into semi-automated and fully automated devices. Semi-automated defibrillators require some user intervention, prompting the operator to deliver a shock after assessing the heart rhythm. They are user-friendly, often used in public spaces. In contrast, fully automated defibrillators analyze the heart rhythm and deliver shocks autonomously without user input. This makes them particularly suitable for untrained bystanders, increasing accessibility and usability in emergencies. Both types play crucial roles in cardiac arrest situations.</p></p>
