<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment & System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Charging</li><li>AC Charging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) encompasses two primary types of charging systems: DC charging and AC charging. DC charging delivers direct current directly to the vehicle’s battery, allowing for rapid recharging, often in 30 minutes or less, making it ideal for commercial and long-distance travel. Conversely, AC charging transfers alternating current, which the vehicle’s onboard charger converts to direct current, offering slower charging speeds suitable for home use and overnight charging, thus supporting daily commuting needs.</p></p>
